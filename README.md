# Clustering-of-cars-into-mini-prime-and-sedan

This case study demonstrates the application of cluster analysis using python program to categorize car models into three distinct classes: mini, prime, and sedan. The analysis utilizes the mtcars dataset to segment 32 car models based on their performance and specification attributes. Key variables such as mpg, hp, am, and gear are used to derive meaningful groupings, providing insights into the characteristics of each car category.
